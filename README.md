In `player_series.py` file you can check the form of a player in his recent games. You have 4 plots and in every plot there's a choice of stat you can check. You can also set the line of the stat, so that might be helpful when you analyse recent player's games
to see if he's worth to put on your parlay. There's no limit to change player (it can't have any typos, otherwise the programm won't work), their minimum minutes and last games, all data are downloaded in time. After you input line, minutes, last games or player's name,
hit Enter to submit. Needed libraries: requests, bs4, pandas, matplotlib, lxml, re, io, html5lib, unidecode. All data is scrapped from https://www.basketball-reference.com/. This project has been inspired by https://www.props.cash/.
